export const metadata = {
  title: 'How can I add a link in bio to TikTok?',
  publishDate: '2024-10-22',
  category: 'link-in-bio',
};

To add a link to your TikTok bio:

1. Switch to a Business Account:

- Go to your profile, tap the menu (three lines) at the top right, then select "Settings and privacy."
- Tap "Account" and choose "Switch to Business Account." This step is essential, as personal accounts don't have the bio link feature.

2. Edit Your Profile:

- After switching, go back to your profile.
- Tap "Edit profile" and look for the "Website" field.
- Enter your desired link here, then save.

Now, your link will appear in your bio, making it easy for your followers to click and explore.
