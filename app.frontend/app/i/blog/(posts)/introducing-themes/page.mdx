Ever since Glow launched, we've had a lot of requests for custom themes. Today, custom themes are finally here!

With this new release, you can create a theme that looks like your brand. You can also re-use it across your other pages.

## How to create a custom theme

Let's take a look at how to create a custom theme.

Once you're logged in, click on the **Themes** button on the right sidebar.

<Image
  src={imageSidebar}
  alt=""
  width={674}
  height={484}
  className="rounded-xl max-w-md"
/>

This will open up the sidebar view that shows you all of your available themes (including the default ones).

At the bottom, click on "Create theme".

<Image
  src={imageSidebarTheme}
  alt=""
  width={994}
  height={1330}
  className="rounded-xl max-w-md"
/>

This will then open up the theme editor. And from here, it's up to you!

At the moment, you can customise the colors of the theme, however we're working on adding more customisation options in the future, such as custom fonts.

<Image
  src={imageThemeEditor}
  alt=""
  width={2858}
  height={1748}
  className="rounded-xl max-w-xl"
/>

export default function MDXArticle(props) {
  return <ArticleTemplate meta={metadata}>{props.children}</ArticleTemplate>;
}
