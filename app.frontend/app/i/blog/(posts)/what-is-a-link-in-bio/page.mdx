Over the past ten years, the creator industry has exploded. We've seen the rise of social media influencers taking advantage of platforms like Instagram and TikTok to build their personal brands and monetize their content.

However the problem has always been, how best to drive traffic from your content to your other channels, and how best to monetize your brand.

Link in bio tools have become a popular solution to this problem. They provide an easy way for individuals and businneses to easily create a landing page for their content, and drive traffic to their other channels. Whether that be a website, a Youtube video, an Etsy store, or a podcast.

## The One-Link Headache

These tools also came about due to the restrictions that platforms such as TikTok and Instagram have on sharing links with posts. Creators have had to find workarounds to share multiple links with their audience, and link in bio tools have become a popular solution.

Tools like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) and [Beacons](https://beacons.ai/) have grown popular due to their ease of use, but they also come with a lot of limitations.

## Building a better link-in-bio

This is where the next generation of link-in-bio tools like Glow come in. Glow does all of the stuff that Linktree and Beacons do, but with a focus on being dynamic and pulling in content from across your socials, rather than being static.

## What can you actually do with Glow?

1. **Link all your socials**: Add your links to your Instagram, TikTok, Spotify, YouTube, and anywhere else you want to share your content.

2. **Add your brand**: Build your page with your brand in mind. Whether you want a pink and sparkly page, or a minimalist black and white page, you can do that with Glow.

3. **Integrate**: Glow can connect to your Spotify, Instagram, and other platforms to pull in your latest content _automatically_!. You can even show what song you're listening to on Spotify live!

... and much more!

## The gateway

It's easy to see why link-in-bio tools have become so popular. Your link-in-bio is the gateway to all of your content, and it's a great way to drive traffic to your other channels.
