**Where should you place your Call-to-Action (CTA) for the best results?** It depends on your audience and content. CTAs above the fold grab attention immediately, while those below the fold let users absorb more information first. Here's a quick breakdown to help you decide:

- **Above the Fold:** Best for quick actions like subscribing or following. They’re visible immediately but may lack context.
- **Below the Fold:** Works well for complex products or detailed pages. Users are more engaged by the time they see these CTAs.

### Quick Comparison

| **Placement**      | **When to Use**                                           | **Key Benefits**                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Above the Fold** | For simple actions requiring minimal context              | Immediate visibility; quick engagement      |
| **Below the Fold** | When users need more context or information before acting | Builds trust; encourages thoughtful actions |

**Tip:** Use both placements when possible - grab attention early and reinforce actions later. Test and optimize using tools like [Linky](https://lin.ky/) to find what works best for your audience.

## Above-the-Fold CTAs

Above-the-fold CTAs are designed to grab attention right away by staying visible as soon as a page loads. This placement ensures they’re seen first, offering users a direct path to take action.

### Why Place CTAs Above the Fold

Positioning CTAs above the fold ensures they’re seen immediately, which can encourage quick engagement. However, this works best when the message is clear and backed by enough context. While the prominent placement can prompt faster decisions, some users might still look for additional details before committing.

### Tips for Designing Effective CTAs

- Use a **clear visual hierarchy** to make your CTA stand out.
- Write **action-focused text** that tells users exactly what to do.
- Make sure the design is **mobile-friendly** so it remains visible and functional on smaller screens.

### How Above-the-Fold CTAs Perform

The effectiveness of an above-the-fold CTA depends on how well it fits into the overall content strategy. For straightforward actions like subscribing or following, the immediate visibility tends to work well. But for more involved decisions, users might need extra information to feel confident about converting.

Linky’s drag-and-drop builder makes it easy to test and adjust your CTA placements, helping you find the sweet spot for maximum impact.

Up next, we’ll look at how below-the-fold CTAs can work alongside this approach.

## Below-the-Fold CTAs

Below-the-fold CTAs are placed after the main content, giving users time to absorb your message before taking action. This approach encourages more thoughtful engagement and decisions.

### When to Use Below-the-Fold CTAs

This placement works well when your content requires explanation or context before prompting action. Examples include:

- Pages packed with detailed information
- Complex products or services needing clear explanations
- Situations where users benefit from making informed choices

People who scroll down to these CTAs are typically more engaged and interested.

### Tips for Designing Below-the-Fold CTAs

To make below-the-fold CTAs stand out, focus on their design and usability. Here are some practical tips:

- Use colors, fonts, or shapes to make CTAs stand out from the rest of the page
- Ensure your page layout works well on both mobile and desktop devices

Tools like Linky's drag-and-drop builder can help you test different designs and placements while keeping the look consistent across platforms.

### How Below-the-Fold CTAs Perform

These CTAs often deliver better results when paired with content that holds users' attention and encourages them to explore further. Align your CTA placement with your overall content flow and user behavior to improve conversion rates.

## How to Choose CTA Location

[Link-in-bio pages](https://lin.ky/i/blog/what-is-a-link-in-bio) are flexible by nature, and with Linky's drag-and-drop builder, you can easily tweak where your CTA (Call-to-Action) appears. Here's how to decide the best spot for it based on content length and user behavior.

### Content Type and Length

Link-in-bio pages change frequently and can range from short to long. Make sure your CTA placement works no matter how much content is on the page, so it stays effective and catches attention.

### User Behavior Patterns

Once you've accounted for content length, think about how people interact with your page on different devices. Link-in-bio pages are designed for both mobile and desktop users, but layouts can impact how visible your CTA is. Optimize its position to ensure it's easy to spot on any screen size.

## CTA Placement Tips

### Using Multiple CTAs

Adding more than one CTA can boost user interaction when placed thoughtfully. Put your main CTA **above the fold** to grab attention right away, and follow it up with a secondary CTA further down the page after providing more context.

Make sure your CTAs stand out visually but still match your design style. For instance, a bold, high-contrast button works well for the primary CTA, while a softer design can highlight secondary options. This approach creates a clear visual flow, helping users navigate your page without feeling overwhelmed. Plus, this strategy works just as well for mobile layouts.

### Mobile Design

Optimizing for mobile is key since most visitors to link-in-bio pages are on their phones. Keep these points in mind for mobile CTA placement:

- Leave enough space between CTAs to prevent accidental clicks
- Place CTAs where thumbs can easily reach them, typically around the middle of the screen
- Use buttons that are at least 44x44 pixels for easy tapping
- Ensure text remains legible on smaller screens

Following these tips will help your CTAs perform better on mobile devices.
