Today, we're excited to introduce our new tool to magically generate your own Glow link-in-bio page from your TikTok profile.

Glow is now a community of over 1500 creators, a lot of which are active on TikTok. We saw those users who were using Glow as a link-in-bio tool, and wondered if we could make it even easier for TikTok creators to build their own link-in-bio pages.

The result is our new auto-generated TikTok link-in-bio pages.

Just connect your TikTok account, and our robots will pull in the latest data from your TikTok profile and build you your own personal Glow page.

You can then customise it with your own branding, add in other blocks, and share it with your audience.

To try it out, click [here](https://glow.as/i/tiktok) to connect your TikTok account!
