};

A "link in bio" is a single URL found in the biography section of a social media profile, typically on platforms like Instagram or TikTok. It serves as a gateway to additional content, like websites, articles, online stores, or multiple links to other platforms, making it a convenient way for followers to explore more about you or your work.

export default function MDXArticle(props) {
